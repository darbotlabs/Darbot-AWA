# ‚ú® The Agentics

Samples of [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw?tab=readme-ov-file).

> [!CAUTION]
> GitHub Agentic Workflows are a research demonstrator, and these workflows are samples only. They should not be used in production, are early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## ‚ö° Quick Start (30 seconds)

To install, first install the `gh-aw` extension:

```bash 
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

Your repository will also need a ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY Actions secret set up to run workflows that use AI models. You can add this using one of the following commands:

```bash
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -a actions --body <your-anthropic-api-key>
#gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY -a actions --body <your-openai-api-key>
```

Then install one or more workflows from this repository as described below.

## üìö Weekly Research

The [weekly research workflow](workflows/weekly-research.md?plain=1) will run each Monday morning to collect research updates from the team and post them to a new issue in the repository.

```bash
gh aw add weekly-research -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run weekly-research

## üíª Coding Tasks

The samples in this repo include workflows that can help with coding tasks, such as solving issues, updating documentation, and performing QA tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Coding tasks should be installed with caution and used only experimentally, and then disabled. While the tasks are executed within GitHub Actions, and are relatively sandboxed, operating over their own copy of the repository, they still operate in an environment where outward network requests are allowed. Also, you will require you to configure additional `Bash` commands to build and test your project by editing the markdown workflow file to add those commands and then running `gh aw compile` to update the workflow. The worfklows below will attempt to "self-report" the commands they need to run, so you can look at the initial reports to see what commands are needed.

### üì¶ Daily Dependency Updater

The [daily dependency updater workflow](workflows/daily-dependency-updates.md?plain=1) will run daily to check for Dependabot alerts in the repository and update dependencies to the latest versions, creating pull requests as necessary.

```bash
gh aw add daily-dependency-updates -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository. After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-dependency-updates
```

**Activity Duration:** By default this workflow will stay active for 48 hours before automatically stopping.

**What it reads from GitHub:**
- Repository contents and dependency files
- Issues and their metadata
- Discussions and community content
- Actions workflow runs and results
- Checks and status information
- Security events and Dependabot alerts

**What it creates:**
- Creates pull requests with dependency updates
- Creates new branches for the dependency changes
- Makes file changes to update dependency versions
- Requires `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è See notes above on coding tasks. This workflow generally doesn't require permissions to build/test code, as you can use existing GitHub CI Workflows to test your code.

## üìñ Regular Documentation Update

The [update documentation workflow](workflows/update-docs.md?plain=1) will run on each push to main to try to update documentation in the repository.
